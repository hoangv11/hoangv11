## Reflecting on Software Engineering

As I am nearing the end of my software engineering course, I realized that the lessons and concepts that I learned extend far beyond simply just building web applications. When it comes to software development, there is much more to the field including the importance of collaboration and teamwork as well as the steps it takes to become a successful software engineer. I was able to develop a very strong foundation in software engineering that I can definitely apply in my future career. Among the many valuable concepts that I was able to explore, some of the most impactful include functional programming, coding standards, design patterns and open-source development. These lessons have not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how much of a difference software can make in the world. 

For instance, open source software development taught me the value of team collaboration and transparency when it comes to developing robust software. Contributing to open-source projects on platforms like GitHub requires using concepts such as coding standards and design patterns to ensure the code remains maintainable and understandable. GitHub has many features which enhance collaboration, such as pull requests, issue tracking, and collaborative workflows, fostering a productive environment for all developers enabling effective collaboration.
