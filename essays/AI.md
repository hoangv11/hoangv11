<h1>Reflecting on My Use of AI in ICS 314</h1>

## I. Introduction 

Artificial Intelligence is playing an increasingly pivotal role in education, offering innovative methods to improve learning and problem-solving. In software engineering, AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude are 
particularly beneficial for writing, debugging, and comprehending code. Throughout ICS 314, I utilized ChatGPT and Claude to tackle coding challenges, resolve errors, and enhance my grasp of essential concepts. These 
tools not only streamlined my workflow but also provided valuable insights and explanations, making complex topics more accessible and reinforcing my learning through immediate feedback and guidance.

## II. Personal Experience with AI:

##### 1. Experience WODS

When working on the experience WODs, I found that it was most effective to not rely on AI tools like ChatGPT initially. Instead, I tackled the problems independently, utilized the provided screencasts and resources, and 
only turned to AI when I was really stuck. This approach enhanced my learning, allowing me to better understand the material and develop my problem-solving skills more effectively.

##### 2. In-class Practice WODs

Similar to the experience WODs, I aimed to limit my use of AI since these activities were focused more on learning than just completing tasks. When in-class practice WODs extended beyond class time, I worked on them at 
home, taking the opportunity to thoroughly learn and understand the material. This approach allowed me to delve deeper into the concepts, reinforcing my knowledge and skills. By independently tackling the problems and 
utilizing AI only when absolutely necessary, I was able to enhance my learning experience and gain a more comprehensive understanding of the coursework.

##### 3. In-class WODs

When it came to in-class WODs, I did not limit my use of AI. Given that these WODs were designed as pass or fail and were timed, using AI provided a crucial safety net. It allowed me to debug my code efficiently and 
quickly, ensuring I could meet the time constraints. The assistance from AI tools helped me navigate through coding challenges more effectively, enabling me to focus on understanding the problem-solving process while 
still adhering to the strict deadlines. This strategic use of AI ensured that I could perform well under pressure and meet the requirements of the timed assessments.

##### 4. Essays

I used AI for essays primarily to generate a structure or outline that I could then expand upon with my own ideas and experiences. This initial framework provided a solid foundation for my writing, ensuring that my 
essays were well-organized and coherent. Additionally, AI was extremely helpful in adding more examples and depth to my essays, enhancing the content and improving the overall flow. Utilizing suggestions generated by AI 
really helped me to enrich my arguments and provide more engaging and comprehensive discussions. 

##### 5. Final Project

The resources provided in this course related to databases were quite limited, making AI an invaluable tool for understanding and learning about databases. In my final project, Study Buddy, I frequently encountered many-
to-many relationships, a topic not thoroughly covered in class. To address this gap, I sought resources outside of class and utilized AI. AI was instrumental in helping me grasp database relationships, serving as a guide 
in my learning process. As a result, I became quite knowledgeable about databases and their interrelationships. In addition, there were many issues that I encoutnered when deploying my project onto vercel. AI served as a 
very good guide to help me set up my environments helping me with any of the issues I encountered.  

##### 6. Learning a concept / tutorial

As previously mentioned, certain topics in the class lacked sufficient resources, making AI an invaluable tool for assistance. In many instances, I found myself needing to explore concepts beyond what was covered in the 
course materials. Whether it was understanding advanced database relationships, deployment processes, or specific coding techniques, I had to seek out additional information outside of class. AI played a crucial role in 
this process, acting as an efficient and accessible resource to help clarify these topics. By providing detailed explanations, step-by-step guidance, and even offering real-world examples, AI enabled me to grasp complex 
concepts quickly and deepen my understanding. With AI as a learning companion, I was able to expand my knowledge and stay on track, even when course resources were limited or when I needed to explore areas not fully 
addressed in class.

##### 7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

During in-class discussions, AI was used to clarify complex topics and significantly improved the flow of discussions. When the discussion topics became more challenging, AI served as a valuable tool for explaining key 
concepts in a simpler manner. This allowed classmates to engage more effectively, ensuring everyone had a clearer understanding. AI helped facilitate the discussions by providing concise summaries, breaking down 
difficult ideas, and offering additional examples, which kept the conversation moving smoothly. Its support ensured that the discussions remained productive, allowing us to explore more complex ideas without confusion.

##### 8. Asking or answering a smart-question

AI was very helpful when creating "smart questions," especially when asking about topics I was unfamiliar with. To get valuable answers and assistance, it’s important to be as specific as possible about the issue, and 
using AI clarified concepts and helped to form a more precise question.

##### 9. Coding Example

When working with coding examples, AI was valuable for providing clear, context-specific examples to demonstrate various coding techniques. Whether it was illustrating how to use a particular function or showing the best 
way to structure a solution, AI helped me quickly understand the application of different concepts, making the learning process more efficient and effective.

##### 10. Explaining Code

When encountering more complex code snippets, AI was extremely helpful in explaining how the code works and what it does, which allowed me to understand how it arrived at a specific outcome. This not only improved my 
understanding of the code but also enabled me to effectively utilize more complex code by understanding how it functioned.

##### 11. Writing Code

AI tools like CoPilot were incredibly helpful with tasks such as styling and UI design. For instance, when I struggled to align items or content properly, especially when it wouldn’t center, AI provided valuable 
assistance in configuring the UI to display exactly as I wanted.

##### 12. Documenting Code

Copilot extremely useful when it came to documenting code. When coding, copilot was able to generate detailed comments explaining specific lines of code and how they function. By providing suggestions on how to document 
complex logic, AI ensured that my code was well-documented and easier for others and myself to follow in the future.

##### 13. Quality Assurance: 

When it came to debugging, AI was invaluable. It helped me fix numerous issues by generating lines of code that allowed me to trace and identify errors in the output. Additionally, AI was able to spot logic errors and 
provide suggestions for improving the code, resulting in more efficient and higher-quality solutions.

#### 14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed

I encountered challenges with various tools and commands essential for the work this semester, especially when navigating unfamiliar processes or configurations. ChatGPT proved to be a valuable resource in helping me 
understand these concepts. For example, in my final project where I wanted to allow users to upload images as profile pictures, I decided to use AWS S3 to store the images as links that postgres can hold allowing for a 
much more scalable project. AWS was not something that was discussed in class and AI was very helpful in helping me configure my S3 bucket and CORS to allow for users to be able to actually interact with the bucket 
through using the application. Whenever I faced errors or struggled with specific tasks, I would input the issue into ChatGPT, which would provide helpful explanations, suggest potential solutions, or guide me through 
troubleshooting steps. This assistance greatly enhanced my problem-solving abilities and allowed me to work through challenges more effectively.
